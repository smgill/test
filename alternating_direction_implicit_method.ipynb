    "# Alternating Direction Implicit Method Applied to the 3D Wave Equation\n",
    "By: Stefen Gill\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the simple explicit and simple implicit methods used in `simple_explicit_implicit_methods.ipynb` can be applied to higher-dimensional problems. However, they become very computationally expensive<sub>[1]</sub>. This motivates the alternating direction implicit method (ADI), which combines the simple explicit and simple implicit methods to produce finite difference discretizations corresponding to efficiently solvable tridiagonal matrix equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "ADI seems to be regarded as a numerical method for solving elliptic and parabolic equations<sub>[2]</sub>. It will be shown in this notebook that ADI can be applied to solving the wave equation, which is hyperbolic:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial t^{2}} = c^{2} \\nabla^{2} u $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\nabla^{2}$ is the spatial Laplace operator. In three dimensions, and letting $c = 1$, the PDE becomes the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial t^{2}} = \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial x^{2}} + \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial y^{2}} + \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial z^{2}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "There is now a choice to be made regarding finite difference discretizations of the spatial derivatives. Either the implicit or explicit methods could be employed to approximate a second derivative in an arbitrary spatial dimension. Superscripts denote a time step and subscripts denote a spatial node for the remainder of this document. The explicit central difference discretization is taken at the current time step, $l$, so that the values of $u$ are known thanks to an initial condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial x^{2}} \\approx \\frac{u^{l}_{i - 1, \\, j, \\, k} - 2u^{l}_{i, \\, j, \\, k} + u^{l}_{i + 1, \\, j, \\, k}}{(\\Delta x)^{2}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "And the implicit central difference discretization is taken at the next time step, $l + 1$. Values of $u$ are unknown in this discretization:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial x^{2}} \\approx \\frac{u^{l + 1}_{i - 1, \\, j, \\, k} - 2u^{l + 1}_{i, \\, j, \\, k} + u^{l + 1}_{i + 1, \\, j, \\, k}}{(\\Delta x)^{2}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than solving for the future values of $u$ in all dimensions at once, the implicit discretization can be applied to one dimension at a time and the resulting tridiagonal matrix equation solved for values at a partial time step in the future<sub>[2]</sub>. Since there are three dimensions that need solving, this partial time step is chosen to be $1/3$ so that a whole step has elapsed after the third dimension is solved.\n",

It is reasonable that equation $(2)$ requires that $\\partial u/\\partial t$ is initially known because the wave equation is second order in time. Physical intuition for this requirement can come from the case of a vibrating string: the position and velocity of a point must be known to predict its future.\n",
